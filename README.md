# Tafuta

* Tafuta - _Search_ in Swahili

The module is a clojure interface for [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)
and [ack](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ack) (other code search tools might follow). It is
supposed to leverage the speed of these tools, but returning results as Clojure data.
